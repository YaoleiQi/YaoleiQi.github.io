<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Southeast University](https://seu.edu.cn), Nanjing. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guanyu Yang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0103/c23024a257233/page.htm/) throughout both my master's and doctoral studies. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree at Southeast University as well. 

My research lies at the intersection of **Deep Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence in Medicine** -- with a special focus on dealing with the tough task in tubular structure analysis that are knowledge-driven and data-efficient. My research interests include **medical imaging**, **weakly-supervised learning**, **network design**, **federated learning**, **foundation model**, and **computer-assisted diagnosis**.

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market, looking for faculty positions in CS, CSE, ECE, IEOR, etc., related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.</strong></strong>
