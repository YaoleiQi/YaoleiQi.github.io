<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Yaolei Qi</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), Nanjing. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guanyu Yang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2023/1024/c23024a469548/page.htm) throughout both my master's and doctoral studies. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree at Southeast University as well. I am now a visiting student at University of Cambridge supervised by Chao Li.

My research lies at the intersection of **Deep Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence in Medicine** -- with a special focus on dealing with the tough task in tubular structure analysis that are knowledge-driven and data-efficient. My research interests include **medical imaging**, **weakly-supervised learning**, **network design**, **federated learning**, **foundation model**, and **computer-assisted diagnosis**, etc.
