<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://cs.jhu.edu). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~schiele/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). As part of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) Ph.D. Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc), I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Christian Rupprecht](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christian.rupprecht/) and [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). From 2018 to 2019, I was a research intern at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). 

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **generative models**, **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**.

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market, looking for faculty positions in CS, CSE, ECE, IEOR, etc., related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.</strong></strong>
